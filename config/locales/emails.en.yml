        After an extensive selection process we unfortunately had to reject your

        We can assure you that this was not an easy decision to make.

        Dear friend,

        This is an automatic notification to inform you that you have been moved to the %{conference_title} waiting list, as a result of not confirming your attendance.

        This action can’t be reversed by any special circumstances.

        Please note that the Internet Freedom Festival is a nonprofit organization, and one of the few international gatherings of its kind to offer totally free attendance. Our entire team works very hard to keep it that way, and closely controlling attendance, for both safety and to provide the experience for everyone.

        Thank you for your interest and understanding.

        We hope we can see you next year :)

        Lots of love, 
        The IFF Team

        Dear friend,

        If you can no longer attend, please let us know immediately so we can
        transfer your spot to somebody else.
